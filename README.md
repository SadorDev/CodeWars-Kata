 This code defines a function called lovefunc that takes two parameters, flower1 and flower2. It then checks whether the remainder of dividing flower1 by 2 is equal to the negation of the remainder of dividing flower2 by 2. If the condition is true, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
